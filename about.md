Hi, I am a self-employed DevOps & Infrastructure Engineer, living in the central north of France.
In a former life, I was a Microsoft PFE, Dell Escalation Engineer, Support Escalation Engineer at HP, and and... the list goes on up to 1995.

Learned a lot and met amazingly talented people  of which I can call some a close friend. But I also discovered I was well on my way to becoming a complete basket case. So I jumped into the deep, switched from  a steady job to the uncertainty as a one-man show, and am loving every minute of it.

What else? I am interested in 'too' many things, ranging from science to history, philosophy, web development with Ruby on Rails, AWS, Linux, Windows Server, ETW tracing, kendo and kenjutsu, gaming, travel planet earth, speaking foreign languages, and many more. My hobbies can be distilled down to just one thing: LEARNING.

Guess that's it. If you like this site, you can follow me on my Twitter [@lgeurts](https://twitter.com/lgeurts) or send a connection request on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucgeurts).

Hi, I am a self-employed DevOps & Infrastructure Engineer, living in the central north of France.
In a former life, I was a Microsoft PFE, Escalation Engineer at Dell, Support Engineer at HP, and the list goes on.

I decided to get out of the 70+ hour weeks (work-life balance?) and start working for myself (again). With success.

What else? I am interested in 'too' many things, ranging from science to history, web development with ruby, linux, windows performance tracing, amazon cloud, kendo and kenjutsu, CSGO gaming, traveling and learning foreign languages, and more. My hobbies can really be distilled down to one thing: learning.

Guess that's all. If you like this site, you can follow me on my Twitter [@lgeurts](https://twitter.com/lgeurts), or send a connection request on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucgeurts).

PS, for a copy of this customized Lanyon template, fork from my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/lgeurts/lgeurts.github.io).

Hi, I am a self-employed DevOps & Infrastructure Engineer, living in the central north of France.
In a former life, I was a Microsoft PFE, Dell Escalation Engineer, Support Escalation Engineer at HP, and and... the list goes on up to 1995.

Learned a lot and met amazingly talented people  of which I can call some a close friend. But I also discovered that I was well on my way to becoming a complete basket case. That and wanting to do more with programming made me switch from 'a steady job' to life as a freelancer. Best decision I ever made (but who knows what's next?).

What else? I am interested in 'too' many things, ranging from science to history, philosophy, web development with Ruby on Rails, AWS, Linux, Windows Server, ETW tracing, kendo and kenjutsu, gaming, traveling the world, speaking foreign languages, and more. 
My hobbies can be distilled down to just one thing: LEARNING.

Guess that's it. If you like this site, you can follow me on my Twitter [@lgeurts](https://twitter.com/lgeurts) or send a connection request on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucgeurts).

I am a self-employed DevOps engineer, living in France,  with a long history of employers including companies as [Hewlett-Packard](http://https://www.hpe.com/ie/en/home.html), [Dell STS](http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/04/premier?c=us&l=en) and [Microsoft Premier Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/premier).

This website serves as a memory backup :) for setting up and configuring BunsenLabs Linux. Besides that you'll sometimes see an occasional rant, weird code, everything that comes up in my mind when spending some free time behind my laptop.

Guess that's all. If you like this site, you can follow me on twitter [@lgeurts](https://twitter.com/lgeurts).

PS, I miss [Ireland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV5QYfpKvEE)

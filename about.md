I am a self-employed DevOps and Cloud Platforms Engineer, living in the central north of France.
In a former life I was a Microsoft PFE, T3 Escalation Engineer at Dell, HP Support Escalation Engineer ..... a long list reaching back to the MSDOS era early 1995.

Learned a lot and met amazingly talented people  of which I can call some a close friend. Sounds great? It is. But I also discovered I could not imagine me doing the same old 'new' things for the rest of my life. Personal growth; stepping out of the comfort zone has always been my primary drive and what's better than having to depend on your own, on your own intuition? So I jumped into the deep, switched to the uncertainty of a one-man show, and am loving every minute of it.

What else? I am interested in 'too' many things, ranging from science to history, philosophy, Ruby on Rails, AWS, Linux, Windows Server, ETW tracing, kendo and kenjutsu, gaming, traveling planet earth, foreign languages, and many more.

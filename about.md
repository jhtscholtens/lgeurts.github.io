Hi, I am a self-employed DevOps & Infrastructure Engineer, living in the central north of France.
In a former life, I was a Microsoft PFE, an Escalation Engineer at Dell, Support Escalation Engineer at HP, and and... the list goes on up to 1995.

Learned a lot and met amazingly talented people  of which I can call some a close friend. But I also discovered that living in hotelrooms for the largest part of your life, working 60+ hour weeks, the constant relocating to another city; will slowly take its toll. So, I left, and started to work as a freelance contractor. Actually the best decision I ever made (but who knows what's next?).

What else? I am interested in 'too' many things, ranging from science to history, philosophy, web development with Ruby on Rails, AWS, Linux, Windows Server, ETW tracing, kendo and kenjutsu, gaming, traveling the world, speaking foreign languages, and more. 
My hobbies can be distilled down to just one thing: LEARNING.

Guess that's all. If you like this site, you can follow me on my Twitter [@lgeurts](https://twitter.com/lgeurts), or send a connection request on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucgeurts).

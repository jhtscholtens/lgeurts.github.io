Hi, I am a self-employed DevOps & Infrastructure Engineer, living in the central north of France.

This website serves as a memory dump for configuring a new BL Linux setup.
Besides that, you'll sometimes the odd rants, weird code, everything that comes up in my mind when spending some free time behind my laptop.

Guess that's all. If you like this site, you can follow me on my Twitter [@lgeurts](https://twitter.com/lgeurts), or connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucgeurts).

PS, for a copy, fork this customized Lanyon template at my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lgeurts/lgeurts.github.io).

Hi, I am a self-employed DevOps & Infrastructure Engineer, living in the central north of France. 

This website serves as my memory for configuring a BunsenLabs Linux setup. 
Besides that, you'll sometimes see occasional rants, weird code, everything that comes up in my mind when spending some free time behind my laptop.

Guess that's all. If you like this site, you can follow me on twitter [@lgeurts](https://twitter.com/lgeurts). The code is available at my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/lgeurts/lgeurts.github.io). 

PS, for professional requests, pay me a visit at [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucgeurts). 

I miss [Dublin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV5QYfpKvEE) (love the video).

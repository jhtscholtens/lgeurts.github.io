LEADER KEY
A leader key is vim’s way to reduce conflicts in configuration. Default it’s backslash, I like space.
• let mapleader=" "

RELOAD VIM CONFIG ON THE FLY
Every time you edit your .vimrc file, if you want to see your changes you have to close and open it  again or source the .vimrc file manually. It’s a pain, so let’s map some keys to do it automatically:
• map <leader>s :source ~/.vimrc<CR>
Once I add this to my configuration, pressing the leader key followed by s will run the command.

PERFORMANCE TWEAKING
• set lazyredraw
• set hidden
• set history=100

ADDING SOME LOGIC TO INDENTING
• filetype indent on
• set nowrap
• set tabstop=2 
• set shiftwidth=2
• set expandtab
• set smartindent
• set autoindent
Tabstop is set 2 because of Ruby.

REMOVE WHITESPACES ON SAVE
• autocmd BufWritePre * :%s/\s\+$//e

HIGHTLIGHT FOUND WORDS IN SEARCH
• set hlsearch

MAKE SEARCH ACT AS IN A MODERN BROWSER
• set incsearch

CANCEL SEARCH USING ESCAPE
• nnoremap <silent> <Esc> :nohlsearch<Bar>:echo<CR>

USE ARROWS INSTEAD VIM DEFAULT MAPPINGS
• map <D-A-RIGHT> <C-w>l
• map <D-A-LEFT> <C-w>h
• map <D-A-DOWN> <C-w><C-w>
• map <D-A-UP> <C-w>W

OPEN PREVIOUSLY OPENED FILE
• nnoremap <Leader><Leader> :e#<CR>
Allows you to quickly move back and forth between two files by pressing the leader key twice.

HIGHLIGHT MATCHING WHEN SELECTING PARENTHESIS
• set showmatch

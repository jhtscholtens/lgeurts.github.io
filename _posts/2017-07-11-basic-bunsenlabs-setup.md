BunsenLabs does not use a traditional desktop like KDE, GNOME or even Xfce. Instead it is a kitbash of components from various open source projects, including the Openbox window manager (which you can easily replace with i3wm), the tint2 panel, the Conky system monitor, and Thunar file manager. The BL developers added a number of scripts and simple utilities to help the user configure the desktop to their liking.
I was a Red Hat/CrunchBang user and currently use Bunsenlabs Hydrogen as my main OS. Overall, it offers a fast, uncluttered Debian experience. Here is a rundown of how I configured the various components to best serve my needs.

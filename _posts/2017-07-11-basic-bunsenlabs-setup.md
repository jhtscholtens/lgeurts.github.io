BunsenLabs does not use a traditional desktop like a KDE, GNOME or even an Xfce. Instead it is a kitbash of components from various open source projects, including most notably the lightweight Openbox window manager (which you can easily replace with i3wm, i'll show you later), the tint2 panel, the Conky system monitor, and Thunar file manager. 

I was a Red Hat/CrunchBang user and currently use Bunsenlabs Hydrogen (next to Windows 10 for my Microsoft customers), as my main OS. Overall, I'm very satisfied. it offers a fast, uncluttered Debian experience using less than half the resources the Windows machine needs to do the same tasks. Here is a rundown of how I configured the various components to best serve my needs.

![BunsenLabs Deuterium, fresh install](/assets/bunsenlabs-deuterium.jpg)
I was a **#!** user until it's main developer, [Phillip Newborough](https://corenominal.org), ended the project after releasing CrunchBang 11 (Waldorf) in May 6, 2013. Looking for something similar, I found and installed the [BunsenLabs](https://www.bunsenlabs.org/) Hydrogen distro. 

BunsenLabs does not use a traditional desktop like a KDE, GNOME or even Xfce. Instead it's an optimized mix of components from various open source projects including most notably the lightweight Openbox window manager, tint2 panel, the Conky system monitor, and Thunar file manager.

This guide is based on [Deuterium](https://www.bunsenlabs.org/installation.html#downloads) which serves as my main OS. Overall, it offers a speedy, uncluttered Debian experience which (in my opinion) is only equaled by distros as for example [ArchLabs Linux](https://archlabsblog.wordpress.com/) or [CrunchBang++](https://www.crunchbangplusplus.org/).

Here is a rundown of how I configured BunsenLabs to best serve my needs:

***1 Status of this document***
-------------------------------

v1.0

Changes since the last version 

***2 Before you begin***
------------------------

Set aside at least half a day to complete the basics – after basic installation and update you'll be adding and configuring a ton of extra files.

***3 Desktop install***
-----------------------

***..3.1 Bunsen install***
Do a generic install from Live USB, when you reboot you'll get an install script – follow it. On my Inspiron it always went without a hitch.

***..3.2 Install adddtional tools***

***4 Desktop apps***
--------------------

***5 Dev environment***
-----------------------

***6 GPG/PGP***

Ian's [Vim After 15 Years](https://statico.github.io/) makes me feel like: **UUHMM, SAY WHUUUT?!**

![Lightline plugin](https://statico.github.io/images/vim/vim3-ale.png)

Fzf and fzf.vim for finding files, ack.vim and ag for searching files, Vim 8 + tmux combi, ALE, the [Vim Awesome](https://vimawesome.com/) community site, and lots more... Time to update my .vmrc.

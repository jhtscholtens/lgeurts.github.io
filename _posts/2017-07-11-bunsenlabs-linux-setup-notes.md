14/07 - UPDATE: the devs at BunsenLabs are working on a new release based on Debian 9 Stretch.

[BunsenLabs](https://www.bunsenlabs.org/) does not use a traditional desktop like a KDE, GNOME or even Xfce. Instead it's an optimized mix of components from various open source projects including most notably the lightweight Openbox window manager (which you can easily replace with [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/), I'll show you later! :)), the tint2 panel, the Conky system monitor, and Thunar file manager. 

I was a #! user until it's main developer, [Phillip Newborough](https://corenominal.org), ended the project after releasing CrunchBang 11 (Waldorf) in May 6, 2013. Looking for something similar, I found BunsenLabs and migrated to Hydrogen. 

This guide is based on [Deuterium](https://www.bunsenlabs.org/installation.html#downloads) which serves as my main OS. Overall, it offers a speedy, uncluttered Debian experience which (in my opinion) is only equaled by distros as for example [ArchLabs Linux](https://archlabsblog.wordpress.com/) or [CrunchBang++](https://www.crunchbangplusplus.org/).

Here is a rundown of how I configured BunsenLabs on my laptop (JARREAU) to best serve my needs:

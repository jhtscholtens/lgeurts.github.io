# Read Me

This is the personal website of Luc Geurts hosted by [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com). You can find it at [lgeurts.github.io](https://lgeurts.github.io).

Credits to [Kyle Stratis](https://github.com/kylestratis) fo the sidebar opacity trick and to [Carlos Becker](https://github.com/caarlos0/caarlos0.github.com) for his article: "Jekyll: Reading time without plugins". I used another solution but he brought me on the idea.

Credits to [Kyle Stratis](https://github.com/kylestratis) for the sidebar opacity trick and to [Carlos Becker](https://github.com/caarlos0/caarlos0.github.com) for his article: 'Jekyll: Reading time without plugins'. Used his formula to create a somewhat different solution (no separate .html file).

This is the personal website of Luc Geurts hosted by [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com). You can find it at [lgeurts.github.io](https://lgeurts.github.io).

Credits to [Kyle Stratis](https://github.com/kylestratis) for the sidebar opacity trick and to [Carlos Becker](https://github.com/caarlos0/caarlos0.github.com) for his article: 'Jekyll: Reading time without plugins'. Used his formula to create my a somewhat different solution as I did not like to create a seperate html file.

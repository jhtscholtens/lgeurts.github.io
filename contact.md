Email

I can be contacted via email using the following addresses:
•luc.geurts@gmail.com for all blog related matters
•lgeurts@protonmail.com for other items

Note on confidentiality

Please note that, as most other people and organizations, I use a 3rd party Mail Service Provider. The staff who work at the provider are technically able to read all my incoming and outgoing mail. This is by definition of how email infrastructure work, and it is irrelevant whether SSL or other encryption is used between email clients and corresponding email servers. If you have something confidential, please use PGP/GPG encryption to secure our communication (see keys.md for info how to obtain and verify my GPG keys).

Note on integrity of my emails

All email sent by me from the protonmail email address should be digitally signed with my email keys.

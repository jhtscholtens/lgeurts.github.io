Email
-----

For blog related matters, use [luc.geurts@gmail.com](mailto:luc.geurts@gmail.com). For anything confidential, mail me at [lgeurts@protonmail.com](lgeurts@protonmail.com).

Note on confidentiality
-----------------------

Please note that, as most other people and organizations, I use a 3rd party Mail Service Provider. The staff who work at the provider are technically able to read all my incoming and outgoing mail. This is how email infrastructures work, and it is irrelevant whether SSL or another encryption is used between email clients and corresponding email servers. 

If you have something really private, please use PGP/GPG encryption to secure our communication.

Note on integrity of my emails
------------------------------

All email sent by me from my protonmail account should be signed with GPG.
